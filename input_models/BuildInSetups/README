This folder contains a few setups for LaMEM, which are build-in setups implying
that you can create the setup within the input file. LaMEM has a few geometrical
objects build in (see /input/lamem_input.dat for a full overview), which you can 
use to construct your own (simple) setup.

Running files with LaMEM is done with:

../../bin/opt/LaMEM -ParamFile <FileName.dat>

And as always, you can use Paraview to visualize the files.

If you are a new user of LaMEM, we recommend you look & run the files in the
following order:

1) FallingBlock_IterativeSolver.dat:
    Nondimensional falling block setup (3D) using PETSc iterative solvers.

2) FallingBlock_DirectSolver.dat:    
    Nondimensional falling block setup (3D) using direct solvers. 

3) FallingBlock_Multigrid.dat: 	   
    Two falling blocks, using a multigrid solver and slightly higher resolution.

4) FallingSpheres_Multigrid.dat:
    Ten falling spheres with multigrid (useful benchmark to test iterative solvers)

5) Subduction2D_FreeSlip_DirectSolver.dat:
    2D viscoplastic free subduction setup
                                       
6) Subduction2D_FreeSurface_DirectSolver.dat: 
    2D viscous free subduction setup with a free surface

7) Subduction3D_DoubleSubduction_FreeSlip_Multigrid.dat: 
    3D viscous setup with 2 subduction zones. Note: you will need to run this one in 
    parallel on larger machine (64 cores or so) as it require a quite large resolution 
    to resolve the weak zones.
    
8) Rifting2D_MultigridSolver.dat:
    2D viscoelastoplastic rifting which results in an asymmetric rift (or symmetric one
    if you change the viscosity of the lower layer).
