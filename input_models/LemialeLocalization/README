This directory contains files to reproduce the Lemiale localization benchmark, which
if an often-reproduced benchmark to test implementations of brittle rheology in 
geodynamic codes. 



1) localization.dat
Example with viscoelastoplastic rheology and no regularization. Thanks to the use
of elasticity it does converge during most timesteps, but not during all. This becomes
apparent after timestep 26 or so. 


2) localization_eta_min_reg.dat
This files contains an example in which we employ the viscosity regularisation 
which is similar, but not identical, to what Duretz et al. proposed in a series of papers.
The regularization viscosity needs to be tuned for different setups: 
    -   If you choose it too small, it results in a shear band width that is smaller 
        than then grid cells and the regularization has no effect (same as non-regularized case)
    -   If you use a too large value, the localization is not very good.

Note that in this file, the regularization viscosity is the minimum viscosity which is thus set 
for the full domain. As a typical required viscosity value is on the order of 1e20-1e21 Pas, this would
interfere with say the viscosity of the lower crust or asthenosphere. 
Therefore, we can also set the viscosity oin a phase-wise manner.


3) localization_eta_st_reg.dat
This is the same as the previous file, but shows how the stabilization viscosituy can be choosen 
in a phase-wise manner
