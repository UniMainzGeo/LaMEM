In this folder, several examples are given of input files for LaMEM
with different level of complexities.

Note that not all input files are consistent with the latest LaMEM 
input file format, as this changed in recent months and we have not
been able to keep all up-to-date. While we are working on doiung this,
we also created a testing framework that runs the input scripts at low
resolution to ensure that they give results that are consistent with a 
previous version of the code.
You can run that with:

python verify_InputModels.py 

If you are a new user of LaMEM, we suggest you to look at the files
in the order given below. Where appropriate, we have added README files 
in the directories.

1) /BuildInSetups
This contains a number of files in which the geometry of the model
is created from within the LaMEM input file. This is a good starting
point if you are a new LaMEM user, and explains both how to run the
code in nondimensional and in dimensional units, for both a simple
linear viscous rheology and for a more realistic viscoelastoplastic 
rheology. 

2) /input
This contains the file lamem_input.dat, which is a generic file
that lists all specifiable LaMEM options. 

3) SubductionWithMATLABParticles
Example of performing a subduction setup, in which the initial model geometry
and temperature structure is generated from within a MATLAB script.

4) /FSSA_Benchmark
Example of a Rayleigh-Taylor bennchmark, showing how the free surface
stabilization algorithm is useful in allowing larger timesteps. It also
shows how a MATLAB-based script is used to create the model setup.

5) /LemialeLocalization
Example of a 2D shear localization setup, which is an often-used bench-
mark for plastic rheologies.

6) /MCC
Example of a 3D metamorphic core complex setup/

7) /Bezier
Gives an example of using a complicated pushing block in a 3D
setup that changes direction with time
