How to run PARAVIEW on SITH and GAIA in Client-Server mode
==============================================================

Aim:
———
Explain how to run paraview in parallel on SITH or GAIA and visualize your runs on your local machine.
The advantage of using SITH and GAIA over JUVIS is that we have massively more memory on our machines.


Installation:
—————
Download the binaries from the PARAVIEW webpage and make sure to unpack the same version on your local machine and on SITH/GAIA.
Make sure that pvserver on SITH/GAIA links to the correct version (maybe modify your .bashrc file)



Howto:
—————

1) First create a local ssh tunnel from your machine to SITH/GAIA:

ssh -f  lkausb@gaia.geo.uni-mainz.de -L 11111:gaia.geo.uni-mainz.de:11111 -N

changing the username to yours.

2) Login to gaia the usual way

ssh lkausb@gaia.geo.uni-mainz.de 

And start paraview in parallel on gaia, by starting an interactive slurm job (for 120 minutes on 16 cores)

	salloc -n 16 --time=600

and in a next step, pvserver with 16 cores:

	mpiexec -n 16 pvserver


3) Start PARAVIEW on your mac. 

4) CONNECT to server in PARAVIEW.

The first time you you do thus you’ll have to create a new connection

Create a new connection to gaia:
	Add server -> 
		Name:			GAIA_TUNNEL (whatever you want)
		Server Type:		Client/Server [default]
		Host:			localhost [default]
		Port:			11111 [default]
	Configure -> Manual


5) Connect to the GAIA_TUNNEL, and it should work
