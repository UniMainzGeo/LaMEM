README

The LaMEM documentation is currently rather poor, and much of what was in the
/doc directory was no longer consistent with the latest version of LaMEM,
causing confusion for new users of the code.

If you are a new user, interested to learn the code, we recommend that you look
at the GitHub page and at the wiki page that is given there, where we have a
number of worked-out examples. You can alsi read the README file in the main
durectory of LaMEM and follow the instructions there.
Having a PDF user-guide is also quickly becoming a bit outdated, so whatever we
wil develop in the future will be in the form or Markdown documents.

This directory contains the following info:

/installation  -  Some example installation instructions for Linux and Mac 
/LaMEM_options -  Some LaMEM (older) options. Note that a full and up to date file with all 
                  working options is located in /input_models/input/lamem_input.dat
/Manual        -  An attempt by Tobias to generate an automatic userguide, left here for 
                  the unlikely case that we decide to finalize this
/Paraview      -  Some instructions on how to connect remotely to Paraview and run pvserver 
                  in parallel (not tested if this still works).
