==============================================
LaMEM - Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model

A parallel 3D numerical code that can be used to model various thermomechanical 
geodynamical processes such as mantle-lithosphere interaction for rocks 
that have visco-elasto-plastic rheologies. The code is build on top of 
PETSc and the current version of the code uses a marker-in-cell 
approach with a staggered finite difference discretization. 

A range of (Galerkin) multigrid and iterative solvers are 
available, for both linear and non-linear rheologies, using Picard and 
quasi-Newton solvers (provided through the PETSc interface).

LaMEM has been tested on over 458'000 cores.


The current version is developed by
  Anton Popov       (Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, popov@uni-mainz.de), 2011-
  Boris Kaus        (JGU Mainz, kaus@uni-mainz.de), 2011-
  Tobias Baumann    (JGU Mainz), 2011-
  Adina Püsök       (JGU Mainz), 2012-
  Naiara Fernandez  (JGU Mainz), 2011-2014
  Arthur Bauville   (JGU Mainz), 2015

Older versions of LaMEM included a finite element solver as well, 
and were developed by:

  Boris J.P. Kaus (ETH Zurich, Switzerland). 2007-2011
  Dave A. May     (ETH Zurich, Switzerland). 2009-2011


The current version is compatible with PETSc version 3.7.x

1. Dependencies
---------------

Essential dependencies-
  i) PETSc 3.7.x
  
1) Dependency Installation
- i) PETSc: 
     See http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/installation.html
     for installation instructions.
     We also provide detailed installation instructions on how to compile 
     PETSc (and mpich, gcc, as well as PETSc with the eclipse debugger environment)
     on various machines in /doc/installation

2) Building LaMEM
- Set the environment variable
     export PETSC_OPT=DIRECTORY_FOR_OPTIMIZED_PETSC
     export PETSC_DEB=DIRECTORY_FOR_DEBUG_PETSC 

- To build the source in the /src directory
     make mode=opt all

- Once build, you can verify that it works with:
    ./bin/opt/LaMEM

    which will run a falling block test with default parameters.

3) Visualize results
   We usually use PARAVIEW for this; a serial binary version can be downloaded 
   from www.paraview.org. Instructions on how to use a parallel version are in /doc
